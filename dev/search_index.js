The justification for including these functionalities in our package is twofold. First, the application of random matrix theory (RMT) in quantum information is a blooming field of research with a plethora of interesting results [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Hence, it is useful to have readily available implementations of known algorithms of generating random matrices. Secondly, when performing numerical investigations, we often need ''generic'' inputs. Generating random matrices with a known distribution is one of the ways to obtain such generic inputs.","category":"page"},{"location":"man/random/#Ginibre-matrices","page":"Random quantum objects","title":"Ginibre matrices","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"man/random/","page":"Random quantum objects","title":"Random quantum objects","text":"In this section we introduce the Ginibre random matrices ensemble [11]. This ensemble is at the core of a vast majority of algorithms for generating random matrices presented in later subsections. Let (G_ij)_1 leq i leq m 1 leq j leq n be a mtimes n table of independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variable on mathbbK. The field mathbbK can be either of mathbbR, mathbbC or mathbbQ. With each of the fields we associate a Dyson index beta equal to 1, 2, or 4 respectively. Let G_ij be i.i.d random variables with the real and imaginary parts sampled independently from the distribution mathcalN(0 frac1beta). Hence, G in mathrmL(mathcalX mathcalY), where matrix G is \\begin{equation} P(G) \\propto \\exp(-\\mathrm{Tr} G G^\\dagger). \\end{equation} This law is unitarily invariant, meaning that for any unitary matrices U and V, G and UGV are equally distributed. It can be shown that for beta=2 the eigenvalues of G are uniformly distributed over the unit disk on the complex plane.","category":"page"},{"location":"man/random/","page":"Random quantum objects","title":"Random quantum objects","text":"In our library the ensemble Ginibre matrices is implemented in the GinibreEnsemble{β} parametric type. The parameter determines the Dyson index. The following constructors are provided GinibreEnsemble{β}(m::Int, n::Int), GinibreEnsemble{β}(m::Int), GinibreEnsemble(m::Int, n::Int), GinibreEnsemble(m::Int). The parameters n and m determine the dimensions of output and input spaces. The versions with one argument assume m=n. When the Dyson index is omitted it assumed that beta=2.

Hence, we will focus on them in the remainder of this section.","category":"page"},{"location":"man/random/","page":"Random quantum objects","title":"Random quantum objects","text":"There are several possible approaches to generating random unitary matrices according to the Haar measure. One way is to consider known parametrizations of unitary matrices, such as the Euler [13] or Jarlskog [14] ones. Sampling these parameters from appropriate distributions yields a Haar random unitary. The downside is the long computation time, especially for large matrices, as this involves a lot of matrix multiplications. We will not go into this further, we refer the interested reader to the papers on these parametrizations.","category":"page"},{"location":"man/random/","page":"Random quantum objects","title":"Random quantum objects","text":"Another approach is to consider a Ginibre matrix G in mathrmL(mathrmX) and its polar decomposition G=U P, where U in mathrmL(mathrmX) is unitary and P is a positive matrix.

Hence, assuming P is invertible, we could recover U as \\begin{equation} U = G (G^\\dagger G) ^{-\\frac{1}{2}}. \\end{equation} As this involves the inverse square root of a matrix, this approach can be potentially numerically unstable.","category":"page"},{"location":"man/random/","page":"Random quantum objects","title":"Random quantum objects","text":"The optimal approach is to utilize the QR decomposition of G, G=QR, where Q in mathrmL(mathrmX) is unitary and R in mathrmL(mathrmX) is upper triangular.

As typical implementations of the QR algorithm do not consider this restriction, we must enforce it ourselves.

These are the circular real ensemble (CRE) and circular quaternion ensemble (CQE). Their sampling is similar to sampling from CUE.
